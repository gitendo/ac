### Notice
Starting October 12th, 2023 GitHub is enforcing mandatory [two-factor authentication](https://github.blog/2023-03-09-raising-the-bar-for-software-security-github-2fa-begins-march-13/) on my account.  
I'm not going to comply and move all my activity to GitLab instead.  
Any future updates / releases will be available at: [https://gitlab.com/gitendo/ac](https://gitlab.com/gitendo/ac)  
Thanks and see you there!
